# Alphacast R SDK

At Alphacast, we usually work with Python rather than R, so we are not publishing this as an official SDK. However, we have created a simple R package that you can use to interact with the Alphacast API.

This package is based on the (Alphacast Python SDK)[https://github.com/alphacastio/alphacast-python-sdk] covering all functions available. Only the methods used in alphacast-test.R have been fully tested.

Feel free to suggest improvements on the code or to create a pull request. If you are interested in participating actively in the development of this package, let us know!
